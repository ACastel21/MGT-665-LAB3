# MGT-665-LAB3
This is a dataset lab used to perform clustering and dimensionality reduction. 


## We used unsupervised machine learning to group individuals based on their health data. The main models used were:
- Hierarchical Clustering before and After PCA
- K-Means Clustering Before and AFTER pca
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

##A sample dataset of 300 people was created with the following :
- Exercise per Day
- Healthy Meals per Day
- Sleep per Night
- Stress Level (1 to 9)
- (BMI)
- 
## We hope to accomplish the following:
- Find natural groupings (clusters) of people to help medical professionals tailor wellness programs
- PCA to reduce the number of features while keeping useful information
- Create results and discussions that are easy to explain
